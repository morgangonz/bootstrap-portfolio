            <p class="lead">
            University of North Florida graduate as of December 2015 with a bachelor's degree in communication, advertising. I am 23 years old. Upon graduation, I worked as the marketing assistant for a nationwide computer security company, AppRiver, located in Pensacola, Florida. As of Fall 2016, I moved to Orlando to begin a full-stack web development bootcamp through the University of Central Florida. I hope to continue doing digital design and using my creativity in the workplace after this program.
            <br><br>
            I consider myself to be a motivated and determined individual. I have spent five consecutive summers working as a beach lifeguard and have learned that hard work pays off.  I am responsible and have excellent focus. In my job as a lifeguard, I have become both a leader and an inspirer for new guards.
            <br><br>
            I am a positive, creative, open-minded individual. I'm an ocean lover and water sports enthusiast. I'm a Mac. I'm a runner and a swimmer. I have done two half marathons and am training for another. I've swam three miles without stopping. I <em>try</em> to remain current in fashion trends and I regularly practice yoga.
